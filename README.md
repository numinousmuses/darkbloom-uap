# Darkbloom

> Contribution workspace for [Layr-Labs/d-inference](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/d-inference). See [how engineering work runs here](.automation/README.md) and the [work board](https://github.com/orgs/numinous-technology/projects/1/views/2).

> **Public Alpha** — Darkbloom is a decentralized private-inference network for Apple Silicon. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and downtime. Alpha pricing, the platform fee and payout rules are stated once, in [billing](docs/architecture/billing.md#invariants).

Darkbloom turns idle Macs into a private, OpenAI-compatible inference cloud.

Today, AI compute reaches you through a stack of markups — chipmaker to hyperscaler to API vendor. Meanwhile, over 100 million Apple Silicon Macs sit mostly idle, each with up to 512 GB of unified memory and up to 819 GB/s of bandwidth — enough to run frontier-scale models at interactive speeds. Darkbloom connects that idle capacity directly to demand, and pays the people who own the machines.

The hard part is privacy. The person running a provider node has root and physical custody of the machine doing your inference — yet they must **not** be able to read your prompts or the model's responses. Darkbloom closes every software path to that plaintext:

- **No observation surface.** Inference runs **in-process** via MLX — no subprocess, no local server, no IPC to tap.
- **Locked-down process.** Debuggers are denied at the kernel level (`PT_DENY_ATTACH`); memory-reading APIs are blocked by Hardened Runtime. These protections are immutable for the process lifetime, because removing them requires disabling SIP, which requires a reboot that kills the process.
- **End-to-end encryption.** The coordinator re-seals every request with NaCl Box (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305) to the provider's attested key, so on the provider machine only the hardened process — never its owner — can decrypt it.
- **Hardware attestation.** A four-layer chain — Secure Enclave signatures, MDM cross-checks, Apple Managed Device Attestation, and APNs code-identity — proves each node's security posture and that it runs a genuine, unmodified binary.

What remains is the same residual threat model Apple accepts for Private Cloud Compute: physically de-soldering and probing memory chips. Everything short of that is engineered out.

The API is OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible, so most clients work by changing one base URL.

## How it works

    subgraph coord["Coordinator · Go · GCP Confidential VM (AMD SEV)"]
        CO["Auth · Routing · Billing<br/>Attestation · E2E relay"]

    end

    U -->|"HTTPS · OpenAI-compatible<br/>TLS + optional NaCl Box"| CO
    CO -->|"WebSocket · outbound from provider<br/>mandatory per-request NaCl Box"| P
    P -.->|"encrypted SSE chunks"| CO
    CO -.->|"streamed response"| U
```

A consumer calls the coordinator over a standard HTTPS, OpenAI-compatible API. The **coordinator** is a Go control plane running in a Confidential VM; it authenticates the request, picks a provider, handles billing, and relays the encrypted payload. **Providers** are Apple Silicon Macs running the `darkbloom` Swift CLI; they connect *outbound* over WebSocket — **no port forwarding or inbound firewall changes are needed** — decrypt the request inside a hardened process, and run inference in-process on the GPU via MLX.

## Privacy & security

Darkbloom is engineered so that **the operator of the Mac running your inference cannot read your prompt or the response.** The only plaintext exposure anywhere is transient — inside the coordinator's hardware-encrypted Confidential-VM memory — and it is never logged or retained.

### Encryption, hop by hop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Consumer
    participant K as Coordinator (CVM)
    participant P as Provider (Secure Enclave-bound)

    C->>K: Request over TLS<br/>(optionally NaCl Box-sealed to coordinator key)
    Note over K: Decrypts in CVM memory for routing + billing.<br/>Never logs or retains prompt content.
    K->>P: Re-encrypts body with a fresh ephemeral key →<br/>provider's attested X25519 key (mandatory NaCl Box)
    Note over P: Only the hardened provider process decrypts.<br/>Runs inference in-process on the GPU.
    P-->>K: Response SSE chunks encrypted to<br/>coordinator's ephemeral key
    K-->>C: Relays response (re-sealed if sender encryption is on)
```

| Hop | Protection |
|-----|------------|
| Consumer → Coordinator | TLS by default; **optionally** NaCl Box-sealed to the coordinator's X25519 key (`GET /v1/encryption-key`) |
| Inside Coordinator | Decrypts in Confidential-VM memory for routing & billing only; **never logs or retains prompt content** |
| Coordinator → Provider | **Mandatory** per-request NaCl Box to the provider's attested X25519 key, with a fresh ephemeral key per request |
| Provider → Coordinator | Response chunks encrypted back to the coordinator's ephemeral key |

> **Precise claim:** Darkbloom is not "the coordinator never sees plaintext." The accurate statement is that plaintext is exposed *only* inside the coordinator's hardware-encrypted CVM memory, is never logged or retained, and is immediately re-encrypted for the selected provider. The provider is the final decryption endpoint, and it is bound to an attested Secure Enclave identity. See [`docs/architecture/security/encryption.md`](docs/architecture/security/encryption.md) and [`docs/consumer/privacy-expectations.md`](docs/consumer/privacy-expectations.md).

### Provider hardening

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| In-process inference | MLX runs inside the provider process — no subprocess, local server, or IPC to observe |
| Hardened Runtime + SIP | Blocks debugger attachment, memory reads, and code injection; immutable for the process lifetime |
| `PT_DENY_ATTACH` | Kernel-level denial of debugger attach |

### Attestation & trust

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    SE["Secure Enclave P-256 key<br/>hardware-bound, keychain-ACL"] --> SIG["Signs attestation blob"]
    SIG --> SS["<b>self_signed</b>"]
    SS --> MDM["MDM SecurityInfo cross-check<br/>SIP · Secure Boot · FileVault"]
    MDM --> MDA["Apple MDA certificate chain<br/>Enterprise Attestation Root CA"]
    MDA --> HW["<b>hardware</b>"]
    HW --> APNS["APNs code-identity attestation (v0.6.0+)<br/>proves the running binary is genuine"]
    CHAL["Challenge-response every 5 min<br/>re-verifies SIP / Secure Boot"] -.-> SS
    CHAL -.-> HW
```

Providers carry one of three trust levels, surfaced on provider-committed responses via the `X-Provider-Trust-Level` header (alongside `X-Provider-Attested`, `X-Provider-Encrypted`, `X-Provider-Chip`, and `X-Provider-Secure-Enclave`). Pre-commit validation and capacity errors have no selected provider and no provider headers. `POST /v1/chat/completions` can copy the committed header fields into a JSON `metadata` object when the caller sets `metadata_details: true` (or `X-Darkbloom-Metadata-Details: true`). The same object also includes region/country GeoIP of the serving provider (`metadata.location`; not a header; no city, coordinates, lookup source, or raw IPs). See [`dispatch.go:3371-3379`](coordinator/api/dispatch.go#L3371-L3379) and [`response_metadata.go:209-276`](coordinator/api/response_metadata.go#L209-L276).

| Level | Verification |
|-------|--------------|
| `none` | No attestation — not admitted for private text traffic |
| `self_signed` | Secure Enclave P-256 signature + periodic challenge-response |
| `hardware` | MDM enrollment + Apple Managed Device Attestation (MDA) certificate chain |

The strongest live-network gate is **APNs code-identity attestation**, which proves the running provider binary is genuine and team-provisioned. Privacy-redacted provider trust status is public at **`GET /v1/providers/attestation`**; hardware serials, UDIDs, and raw Apple certificates remain private to providers and the coordinator.

## Quickstart (consumers)

The API is OpenAI-compatible — point any OpenAI SDK at the Darkbloom base URL.

**Base URL:** `https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1`
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, where `<key>` is an API key (`sk-db-…`, created in the [console](https://console.darkbloom.dev)) or a Privy session JWT.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1",
    api_key="sk-db-...",
)

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemma-4-26b",                       # use an id from GET /v1/models
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Darkbloom!"}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

```bash
curl https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-db-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gemma-4-26b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}],"stream":true}'
```

The **Anthropic Messages API** works too — point the Anthropic SDK at the same base URL and use `/v1/messages`.

See [`docs/consumer/quickstart.md`](docs/consumer/quickstart.md) for authentication, streaming, and SDK details.

## API surface

OpenAI-compatible, with Anthropic Messages support. Inference endpoints require a Bearer key; reads marked *public* need no auth.

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions (streaming + non-streaming) |
| `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses API (auto-detects `input` vs `messages`) |
| `POST /v1/completions` | OpenAI legacy text completions |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API |
| `GET /v1/models` | List models (OpenAI shape) |
| `GET /v1/models/{id}` | Retrieve a model |
| `GET /v1/models/catalog` | *Public* — full model catalog with Darkbloom metadata |
| `GET /v1/pricing` | *Public* — live per-token pricing |
| `GET /v1/encryption-key` | *Public* — coordinator X25519 key for optional sender-side sealing |
| `GET /v1/providers/attestation` | *Public* — privacy-redacted provider attestation status |
| `GET /v1/payments/balance`, `GET /v1/payments/usage` | Account balance and usage |

Supported across the inference endpoints: **streaming (SSE)**, **tool / function calling**, **vision / multimodal** input, **reasoning models**, and server-side **continuous batching** for throughput. `n > 1` is rejected with `400` (on chat completions and the Responses API). Unimplemented OpenAI endpoints (e.g. `/v1/embeddings`) return a structured `404`.

Full request/response schemas: [`docs/reference/api-contracts.md`](docs/reference/api-contracts.md).

## Models

The model catalog is **owned by the coordinator** and DB-backed — there is no hardcoded model list. Consumer-facing names are stable aliases (e.g. `gemma-4-26b`, `gpt-oss-20b`) that resolve to concrete, versioned builds; aliases can be re-pointed to new builds without breaking clients. Providers download approved models from `https://models.darkbloom.ai` and verify per-file and aggregate SHA-256 hashes before serving.

**The authoritative, live list is always [`GET /v1/models`](https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/models)** (or the public `GET /v1/models/catalog`). Representative current models:

| Alias | Family | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `gemma-4-26b` | Gemma 4 (MoE, ~4B active) | Google's latest MoE; multimodal (text + vision) |
| `gpt-oss-20b` | GPT-OSS 20B (MoE, ~3.6B active) | OpenAI open-weight reasoning model |

Quantization and exact build details evolve — query `/v1/models` rather than hardcoding them. See [`docs/consumer/models.md`](docs/consumer/models.md).

## Pricing

Pricing is per-token and resolved per request: a provider's custom price, else a platform price, else built-in fallbacks.

| Item | Fallback default |
|------|------------------|
| Input tokens | $0.05 / 1M |
| Output tokens | $0.20 / 1M |
| Minimum charge | $0.0001 / request |
| Platform fee | see [billing invariants](docs/architecture/billing.md#invariants) |

Per-token rates target roughly half of comparable hosted APIs. **Live per-model pricing is always at [`GET /v1/pricing`](https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/pricing).** Funding uses Stripe deposits into the internal micro-USD ledger; provider payouts run through Stripe Connect. Requests routed to your own machine via [self-route](#self-route--direct-mode) are **free**. See [`docs/reference/pricing-model.md`](docs/reference/pricing-model.md).

## Run a provider

Earn by serving inference on your idle Mac — and stop paying for your own usage via [self-route](#self-route--direct-mode).

### Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **Chip** | Apple Silicon (M1+) | M1 Pro/Max/Ultra or newer |
| **macOS** | 14 (Sonoma) | Latest stable |
| **Memory** | 8 GB (start is rejected below 8 GB) | 32 GB+ for large or multi-model |
| **Disk** | 50 GB free | 100 GB+ |
| **Network** | Outbound HTTPS (443) | Low-latency path to `api.darkbloom.dev` |

A model loads when it fits in available memory plus a small headroom (`weights + ~2 GB`), after the OS reserve. See [`docs/provider/hardware-requirements.md`](docs/provider/hardware-requirements.md).

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://api.darkbloom.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Zero prerequisites and no `sudo`. The installer fetches the latest signed release, verifies the bundle / binary / `mlx.metallib` SHA-256 against the coordinator's release record, checks the Apple Developer ID code signature, provisions the Secure Enclave helper, and offers to install the MDM enrollment profile for hardware trust. See [`docs/provider/installation.md`](docs/provider/installation.md).

### First run

```bash
darkbloom start              # background launchd service (interactive model picker + memory policy)
darkbloom start --foreground # run attached to the terminal
darkbloom idle keep-loaded   # keep models loaded while idle (instant responses); default frees after 60 min
darkbloom login              # link your account (RFC 8628 device-code flow)
darkbloom status             # config, hardware, schedule, live trust verdict
darkbloom doctor             # local diagnostics + coordinator's trust view
```

[`docs/provider/quickstart.md`](docs/provider/quickstart.md) walks through the full flow.

### CLI reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `start` | Start serving (launchd daemon, `--foreground`, or `--local`) |
| `stop` / `restart` | Stop (`--uninstall` removes the agent) / restart in place |
| `status` | Hardware, config, schedule, and live daemon/trust state |
| `doctor` / `verify` | Diagnostics (`verify` = strict, non-zero on any warning) |
| `models` | `catalog`, `list`, `download`, `remove` cached models |
| `login` / `logout` | Link / unlink the provider to a Darkbloom account |
| `enroll` / `unenroll` | MDM enrollment for hardware-trust attestation |
| `benchmark` | Local tokens/sec benchmark |
| `update` | Check for and apply provider updates |
| `logs` | Tail provider logs |

There is **no** `serve` or `earnings` command — use `start`, and view earnings in the [console](https://console.darkbloom.dev). Full flags: [`docs/provider/cli-reference.md`](docs/provider/cli-reference.md).

### Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/darkbloom/provider.toml` (created on first start):

```toml
[provider]
name = "darkbloom-mac-1"
memory_reserve_gb = 4
auto_update = true
auto_restart = true

[backend]
enabled_models = []        # empty = advertise all downloaded models
idle_timeout_mins = 60     # free when idle: unload after N idle minutes, reload on demand (0 = always ready)
max_model_slots = 3        # max models resident at once
continuous_batching = true

[gemma_optimizations]
prefill_layer18 = true     # default ON; 18-layer prefill submissions
weighted_r1 = true         # default ON; coupled weighted-unsort + safe R1

[coordinator]
url = "wss://api.darkbloom.dev/ws/provider"
heartbeat_interval_secs = 5
private_only = false       # true = serve only your own self-route traffic

# Optional availability windows — outside them the node disconnects and frees GPU memory
[schedule]
enabled = true             # windows only take effect when this is true

[[schedule.windows]]
days  = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"]
start = "22:00"
end   = "08:00"
```

`[gemma_optimizations]` is authoritative for production provider processes.
Both selected controls default to `true` even when an older config omits the
section. To roll back either optimization, set its key to `false` and run
`darkbloom restart`; restart is the activation boundary.

## Self-route & direct mode

Running a node also makes your **own** inference free.

- **Self-route** — *"use my own machine, for free."* Add `X-Darkbloom-Route: self` to any request to route **only** to a provider your account owns: free, end-to-end encrypted, with no fallback to the paid fleet (you get an explicit error if your machine can't serve). `X-Darkbloom-Route: prefer` routes to your machine first but falls back to the paid fleet so you're never stuck. An API key can also be pinned to owned-only with `self_route_only`. See [`docs/provider/self-route.md`](docs/provider/self-route.md).

- **Direct mode** — when the client can reach your Mac (same machine / LAN / tailnet), `darkbloom start --local` serves an OpenAI-compatible endpoint locally and **skips the coordinator entirely**: lowest latency, offline-capable, bytes never leave your network. See [`docs/provider/direct-mode.md`](docs/provider/direct-mode.md).
